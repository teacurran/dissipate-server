## notes for initial setup

You must import the project first inside the environment you want to setup, for example `google-dev`:

```
terraform init
terraform import module.dissipate.google_project.project dissipate
```

Then run `terraform plan` to see what changes will be made

Then run `terraform apply` to apply the changes.
